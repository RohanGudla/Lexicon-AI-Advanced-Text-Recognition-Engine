# Text Recognition with OpenCV and Tesseract

## Overview

This project involves text recognition using OpenCV and Tesseract, inspired by a PyImageSearch blog post by Adrian Rosebrock. It enables you to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on images. Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

## Installation

1. Install Tesseract OCR:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
   ```

2. Verify Tesseract installation:

   ```bash
   tesseract -v
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can perform text recognition on an image with the following command:

```bash
python text_recognition.py --east frozen_east_text_detection.pb --image images/example_01.jpg
```

You can also add padding to the bounding boxes using the `--padding` option:

```bash
python text_recognition.py --east frozen_east_text_detection.pb --image images/example_05.jpg --padding 0.05
```

This project leverages OpenCV and Tesseract and is a valuable tool for optical character recognition tasks involving image-based text.

## Conclusion

Text recognition with OpenCV and Tesseract provides an efficient solution for extracting text from images. It can be applied to a wide range of applications requiring OCR capabilities.
